# react-vitejs-template
React and Vite template to build a react app easily.

## Conventional commits enforcement
To enforce conventional commits, this template use :
### - Commitlint : 
A linting tool to check if your commit messages meet the conventional commit format.

### - Husky : 
A handy git hook helper, to check your commit message before making any git commit.

### - Commitizen :
A CLI tool to help us fill out any required commit fields at commit time.
